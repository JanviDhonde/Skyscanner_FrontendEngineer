# Skyscanner_FrontendEngineer
I recently participated in Skyscanner’s Front-End Software Engineering job simulation on Forage, where I built a web application using React and Skyscanner’s Backpack library. I developed a travel date selection page, customized the application, and ran automated tests, deepening my passion for front-end engineering.
