## Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering Job Simulation  
**Skyscanner_FrontendEngineer:** <br>
I recently participated in Skyscanner’s Front-End Software Engineering job simulation on Forage, where I built a web application using React and Skyscanner’s Backpack library. I developed a travel date selection page, customized the application, and ran automated tests, deepening my passion for front-end engineering..

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository documents my experience in the **Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on the Forage platform. During this simulation, I worked as a **front-end engineer** and built a web application using **React** and **Skyscanner’s open-source Backpack library**. I focused on creating a user-friendly page where users can select a travel date, customized the application, and ran automated tests to ensure its functionality.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Building a Web Application with React**  
   - Developed a simple **web page** using **React** that allowed users to pick a travel date.
   - Used **Skyscanner’s open-source Backpack React library** to speed up development and ensure a consistent and user-friendly interface.

2. **Customizing the Application**  
   - Customized the application to match Skyscanner’s design principles, ensuring it was intuitive and easy for users to interact with.

3. **Automated Testing**  
   - Ran **automated tests** to ensure the page rendered correctly and functioned as expected across different environments, catching potential issues early.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **React Development**: Gained hands-on experience with **React** to create interactive and responsive front-end components.
- **Open-Source Contribution**: Used **Skyscanner’s Backpack React library**, contributing to and learning from open-source resources.
- **JavaScript Programming**: Enhanced my **JavaScript** skills to manipulate data and manage application state effectively.
- **Web Application Customization**: Customized the front-end to suit user needs and aligned with Skyscanner's design standards.
- **Automated Testing**: Applied **automated testing** to ensure the application performed consistently, improving development efficiency.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Front-End Development**: Strengthened my ability to develop front-end applications, with a focus on building intuitive user interfaces and experiences.
- **React & Backpack**: Deepened my knowledge of **React** and the **Backpack** library, which is widely used for designing scalable and user-friendly front-end applications.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Improved my ability to write and run automated tests, catching potential issues early in the development cycle.
- **Open-Source Awareness**: Gained insight into the value of **open-source** libraries and how they enable rapid development and foster collaboration.

**Objective:**  
This repository highlights my involvement in Skyscanner's **Front-End Software Engineering Job Simulation**, where I applied **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Backpack** to build and customize a travel date selection page. The experience deepened my passion for front-end engineering and the power of open-source development. I am eager to apply the skills I developed during this simulation as part of a front-end engineering team at a company like Skyscanner, where I can contribute to making travel planning easier for millions of users worldwide.

**Simulation Details:**  
Completed via **Skyscanner Front-End Software Engineering Job Simulation** on Forage  
**Certificate of Completion Issued by:**
